# Semantic-Segmentation-for-RGB-Aerial-Images in collaboration with the Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich

Semantic Segmentation is crucial for UAVs for finding suitable landing spot at a random outdoor environment, especially for an emergency landing situation. In this work in collaboration with ASL at ETHH Zurich, i have tried to address this issue using semantic segmentation for aerial images, taken from a real drone. we use the state-of-art semantic segmentation network Full Resolution Residual Network (FRRN) for semantic segmentation of these images, which could be used to develop an algorithm
to guide the UAV towards suitable landing spot. The proposed framework has been successfully tested on real UAV datasets and in challenging real-world environments.The trained model was also tested on real camera RGB-images of ASL-ETH Zurich drone dataset, which gave very favorable results.

Please do also find the poster (Final_poster.pdf) for this project which gives more detailed answeres for the results and accuracy.
